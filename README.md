<br/>
Additional Notes:  <br/>
Need to add all of the owner stuff and the asserts        <br/>
Look into Account abstraction <br/>
Look into events     
look into changing states of the games straight from cairo instead of doing something from the server cli <br/>
LOOK INTO SNARKS INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT WAY OF WINNING THE GAME (most likely STARKs) <br/>
Find ways to start to transition the server into the chain <br/>
add the possibility (in conjuction with unity) to get back into lobby by looking at the address might need another storage var<br/>
Possibility of breaking down the contract <br/>

<br/>

| Progress    | Task        | Notes   |     
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------   |
| âš« |Autoconnect on game startup if server is available | the first scene will be used as a landing page for the game/website so no autoconnect |
| ðŸ”µ |Offline scene finished|  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Receive address data on connect|  |
| ðŸŸ  |change from the playerprefs or put ifend regions int he code | the way that saved data is stored in between scenes is not a permanent way, if anything use react backend to store data inbetween scenes |
| ðŸ”µ |Main util script to be accessed from everywhere|  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Check if two of the same players exist in the server if so kick|  |
| ðŸŸ  |Implement keys used for encryption|    |
|  ******  | ****** |  ******  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Host game menu section|  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |join game menu section|  |
| ðŸ”µ |Deck building menu section|  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Loading menu section|  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Setting menu section|  |
| ðŸŸ  |Contract view menu section| this menu is a mess  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Receive transaction updates|  |
| ðŸ”µ |Finish the menu UI| check the contract menu and have the final UI in place |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Show all availabe games|  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Basics of matchmaking and player made lobbies|  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Webhook to discord to be used as a database|  |
| ðŸŸ  |Send webhooks to discord on starting lobby and joining lobby| all implemented in the Util script, just need to set up the lobby the correct way |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Pop up error UI|  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Sorting algos for the various menus|  |
| ðŸ”´ |Basic all roudn progression checks| example: the player is able to join a lobby without selecting a team, should not be allowed |
|  ******  | ****** |  ******  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Basics of RealmsUI |  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Basics of troopsUI|  |
| ðŸŸ  |Basics of adventurerUI|  |
| ðŸ”µ |Tooltip on hover over units and realms| core logic is done just needs to be implemented everywhere |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Able to select the realms by looking for their ID|  |
| ðŸ”µ |Player is able to make its team and save it to be then used in game| if the player goes back into the deckmenu there are errors, probably issues with references |
| ðŸ”´ |Receive data from NFT|  |
| ðŸ”´ |Lobby exists until the original host goes|  |
| ðŸ”µ |Write data to Database account troops contract|  |
| âš« |Implement a resource folder so every prefab is available there in conjunction with the generalUtil script |  |
|  ******  | ****** |  ******  |
| ðŸ”µ |function to update the player ont he server side with the client side data| use the specific targetRPC example to improve on the efficiency of the server calls |
| ðŸ”´ |divide the game into different states/rounds|  |
| ðŸŸ¢ |Fix the names so they show in the lobby|  |
| ðŸŸ  |Connect the skirmish main contract to the game |  |
| âš« |Only allowed to start the game after both players are ready|  |
| ðŸ”µ |Turn based functionality setup| there but not implemented with the card placing  |
| ðŸ”µ |Once the game starts send data to server so both clients can communicate| this is implemented but for now only works with a button, should be called at the start of the scene |
| ðŸ”µ |Once a player places a card replicate action on the other client| cards do appear on the other client but issue thrown, something along the lines of missing reference and its not turn based yet |
| ðŸ”µ |Prohibit client from interacting with the other client's card| should be implemented but not tested |
| ðŸŸ  |Add basic game score mechanic | score mechanic is there but for some reason only works on the first call, probable issue with the detection of child objects |
| ðŸŸ  |Add basic server checks in the middle of moves to validate moves| previous states of the deck and possible cards are all stored in the turnmanager, just need to call it to compare so no "added" cards via exploits are possible |
| ðŸ”´ |Before the start of the game check the deck is valid| same as above  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
| ðŸ”´ |Deal with the outcome of the match| there are no turns states implemented yet |
| ðŸŸ  |Deal with instances from either players disconnecting early or server failure|  |
| ðŸ”´ |Deploy mock server on AWS|  |
